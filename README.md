### RESTful API

[what is a restful api](https://medium.com/@lazlojuly/what-is-a-restful-api-fabb8dc2afeb)

It is really just the architecture, plus a set of constraints applied on the architecture producing the desired architecture.

By applying these constraints, we end up with a desired architecture which is optimised for the common use cases.

### GraphQL

[what is graphql](https://medium.com/devgorilla/what-is-graphql-f0902a959e4)

GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics:

* It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
* It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
* It uses a type system to describe data.

## Operating System
### Linux, Shell, Bash, relation with MacOS
* Linux是Unix-like
* MacOS是基于Unix开发的操作系统
* Shell是包裹在上述系统内核层外的壳，它提供了一种语言，这种语言可以让外界用户与操作系统内核沟通。Bash是一种实现了Shell功能的软件，这种软件目前是很多unix-like及MaxOS的默认Shell软件。
